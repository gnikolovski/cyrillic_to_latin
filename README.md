## INTRODUCTION

Converts cyrillic to latin letters on the fly for Serbian language. At this 
moment, the module will convert only strings that are passed through Drupal t() 
function. That means that content won't be translated.

There is one special case that this module handles. If you are using the Address 
module, country name will be converted to latin.

## REQUIREMENTS

None.

## INSTALLATION

1. Install the module as usual via Drupal UI, Drush or Composer.
2. Go to "Extend" and enable the Cyrillic to Latin module.

## CONFIGURATION

None.
